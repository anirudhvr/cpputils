========

C++ utility libraries

* Regular expressions using POSIX regex(3) when Boost is just too heavy
  or annoying to install
* Some other space/time-saving things (timers, perl-like string
  chomp/split, string convert to anything and back, etc.
* Wrapper library for mysqlpp and Patricia (structure to store IP
  addresses/address ranges as a prefix trie)
